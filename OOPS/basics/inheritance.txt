DRY -- don't repeat yourself


inhertiance gives you code reusability



PARENT CLASS 

CHILD CLASS ---  data members (variable)   , all methods , constructors

private members are not inherited 



SINGLE LEVEL                           MULTILEVEL                      Hierarchical                     Multiple (Java does not have this)
 
-parent                                 -parent(dada)                   parent                             parent   mother
