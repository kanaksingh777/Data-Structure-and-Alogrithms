polymorphism

#method overriding
#method overloading 
#operator overloading

#method overriding - method with the same name exists in the parent and the child class , if the object of a child class is created the object 
will call the child class method 

--real world -- u could have joined the parent business but you choose what u want

# if a child class doesn't have a constructor , then the constructor for the parent class gets called , but if the child class has a constructor
#the constructor for the parent class gets invoked.
