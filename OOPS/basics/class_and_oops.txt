oops notes


-- everything in python is an object

-- L  = [1,23,4,5]

this L is a object 

it can also be initialized as L = list()





FUNCTION VS METHOD 

--method is a function definded under a class , and can be accessed by the object of the class only



#constructor is a method that doesn't give control to the user 


UNDERSTANDING ---self : 
def __init__(self): 
this self and sbi have the same address let's say ---2273472035680

which basically means sbi is self 
# the object that we are currently working with is self 

sbi =ATM()




----------------------------XXX--------------

#ENCAPSULATION :
an object can only use the variable that is data and method inside a class,
but sometimes we don't want to user to see the data or certain method, we make those variable private by using  double underscore

   self.pin =" " 
   self.__pin =" "


java -private ---access modifier 


the moment we put __pin  , inside python it will get converted into _Atm__pin during execution

# nothing in python is truely private 


#reference variable 

if we create like
Atm()-- in this an object is alredy created but it can't be accessed 

--when we create sbi = Atm() 
sbi is not actually the object
sbi is a variable to store the object Atm()  ---the variable that is used to store the object is called REFERENCE variable


call by reference
pass by reference 


# class k objects are also mutable like list dictionary and sets 


loops over objects 


L = [c1,c2,c3]

# for i in L :
#     print(i.name, i.age)

for i in L:
    i.intro()


STATIC --

so let's say in the ATM CLASS --- whenever a new user comes in , each object should have a serial number in an order 

instance variable ==== vo variable jo har bar define hota h , means the variable value for each object is different 

the condition - 

class variable = me need to maintain a counter
isfc code for a branch cust will be the same == class variable /static variable


instance variable are inside constructor 
statiic / class variable are in the class like

class ATM()
    counter =1 -- this is a static variable
